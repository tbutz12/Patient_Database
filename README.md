# Patient_Database
I have created a database called ‘PatientDB’ that can show records
of a given patient by searching by the patient’s name. The database
was created through a Linux bash terminal using MySQL. I used this
database and imported it into a Java Swing UI, making it easy for
the user to type in a patient and retrieve various details.
From searching the patient, you can see basic information about
them, such as sex, their primary care physician, what insurance
provider they have, the medication they are on, a description of
that medication, and the side effects of that medication. After
searching for a patient, you can look at further details from
their most recent visit. Reports such as labs, diagnoses, imaging,
pathology, and procedures are viewable after clicking visit information.
This database was made to target any type of health provider that would
need to see very descriptive patient details, such as a doctor’s office
or a pharmacy.
